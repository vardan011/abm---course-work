	A recursive function is a function that calls itself. This is in the case of direct recursion.
 There is also indirect recursion - when two or more functions call each other. When a function calls itself,
a copy of its parameter values is created on the stack, after which control is transferred to the first executable function statement.
 When called again, the process is repeated. Recursive functions are an alternative to loops.
