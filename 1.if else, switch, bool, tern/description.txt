	There are two main forms of conditional statements found in real programming languages:
the conditional operator (if) and the multivalued choice operator (switch, case).

	The conditional operator implements the execution of certain commands, provided that some logical expression (condition) takes the value "true".

	The switch executes one specified branch, depending on the value of the evaluated keyword.
The fundamental difference between this instruction and the conditional operator is that the expression that determines the choice of the executable branch returns not a boolean,
but an integer value, or a value whose type can be cast to an integer.

	Boolean data type, or boolean type, a primitive data type in computer science that takes two possible values, true or false (1 or 0). A Boolean data type can be implemented and stored in memory using only one bit,
but usually the smallest addressable memory location (usually a byte or machine word) is used as a more efficient storage unit when working with processor registers and main memory in terms of performance.
	
	?: is a ternary operator that is part of the syntax for basic conditional expressions.  An expression a ? b : c evaluates to b if the value of a is true, and otherwise to c.
