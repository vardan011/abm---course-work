	We already know that a variable is a cell in the computer's memory where one single value can be stored.
 An array is an area of memory where multiple values can be stored sequentially.
	When creating a static array, only a constant can be used to specify its size.
 The size of the allocated memory is determined at compile time and cannot be changed at runtime.
 If there is a need to create a variable, the size of which is unknown in advance, then dynamic memory is used. It's the same in this case.
